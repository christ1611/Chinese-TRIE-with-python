# Chinese-TRIE-with-python
This project is similiar with the previous one

The advantage of this version instead of the C++ version
1. The array size is dynamic
2. With tensorflow, it can increase the learning rate of the TRIE
3. The pip3 pinyin can help to solve the tranlation between hanzi <-> pinyin
4. All the feature,model and training dataset is similiar with the C++ version, however the code in python is shorter and more efficient

Pre-requements:
1. Ubuntu16.04 LTS or advanced
2. Please install tensorflow, pinyin and codecs before using this
